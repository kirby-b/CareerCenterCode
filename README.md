# Career Center Code Challenges
In my Junior year of highschool, I attended the BAISD Career Center as a first year student. I also returned senior year as a second year student, but this is the code from my first year assignments. Obviously these are not the most advanced programs and I didnt even get into using GUIs like AWT, JavaFX, or Swing. Some of the assignments have incorrect assignment numbers in their file so I cant guarentee they are all in the correct places.

I put this here as both a reminder on how java works and a good example of a learning path for any language. On that note, I may recreate these programs with other languages.
